# Switch & Cloud Controller - Mixed Load Simulation
# Realistic mixed usage: some idle users, some active, some streaming
#
# This simulates a real WiFi environment where not all users are equally active
#
# Usage:
#   python3 -m nettest scenario sweep -s scenarios/switch_mixed_load.yaml --server 10.10.10.2
