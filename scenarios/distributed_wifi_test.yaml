# Distributed WiFi Test Configuration
# For real multi-device testing across physical WiFi clients
#
# This scenario is designed to be run from MULTIPLE physical devices
# simultaneously to test real WiFi performance.
#
# Example Setup (15 total clients):
#   - 3 laptops on WiFi
#   - Each laptop runs 5 simulated clients
#   - Total: 15 real WiFi clients
#
# Usage on each device:
#   python3 -m nettest run -p scenarios/distributed_wifi_test.yaml -s 10.10.10.2 --clients 5
#
# Or use the distributed test script:
#   ./scripts/run_distributed_test.sh --server 10.10.10.2 --clients 5
