# Crowded WiFi Environment
# Simulates high-density WiFi (conference, stadium, coffee shop)
#
# Use case: Testing AP capacity limits
# Typical scenario: 30-100+ devices, heavy contention

name: "Crowded WiFi (High Contention)"
description: "High-density WiFi with significant contention"

latency:
  delay_ms: 25
  jitter_ms: 30          # Very high jitter due to contention
  correlation_pct: 50
  distribution: pareto   # Long-tail delays from queue backups

packet_loss:
  loss_pct: 3            # Notable loss from collisions
  correlation_pct: 40    # Bursty loss pattern

# Gilbert-Elliott for realistic burst loss during contention

bandwidth:
  rate: "15mbit"         # Severely limited per-client share
