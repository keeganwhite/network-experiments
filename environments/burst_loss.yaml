# Gilbert-Elliott model for burst loss
# The network alternates between "good" and "bad" states
# p13: probability of entering bad state (%)
# p31: probability of leaving bad state (%)
# p32: probability of loss while in bad state (%)
# p14: probability of ECN marking (%)
packet_loss:
  loss_pct: 0        # Use Gilbert-Elliott instead of random
  p13: 5             # 5% chance to enter burst loss state
  p31: 80            # 80% chance to recover from burst state
  p32: 50            # 50% loss when in bad state
  p14: 0             # No ECN marking
