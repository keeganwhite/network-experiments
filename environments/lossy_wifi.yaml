# Lossy WiFi Environment
# Simulates congested or weak WiFi signal
#
# Use case: Test packet loss handling, TCP retransmission behavior
# Typical scenario: Crowded coffee shop, weak signal at edge of coverage

name: "Lossy WiFi"
description: "Congested or weak WiFi with high packet loss"
interface: ""

latency:
  delay_ms: 10       # Low base latency
  jitter_ms: 20      # But high jitter due to contention
  correlation_pct: 50

packet_loss:
  loss_pct: 5        # 5% packet loss - significant
  correlation_pct: 25  # Correlated loss (burst patterns)

corruption:
  corrupt_pct: 0.1   # Occasional bit errors
  correlation_pct: 0

# No bandwidth limit - WiFi can still be fast between drops
