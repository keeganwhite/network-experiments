# Datacenter Environment
# Simulates low-latency datacenter network
#
# Use case: Baseline testing, verify performance under ideal conditions
# Typical values: <1ms latency, minimal loss

latency:
  delay_ms: 0.5      # Sub-millisecond latency
  jitter_ms: 0.1     # Very stable
  correlation_pct: 0

packet_loss:
  loss_pct: 0.01     # Extremely rare loss
  correlation_pct: 0

# No bandwidth limit - datacenter has high capacity
