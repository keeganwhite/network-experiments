# Submarine Cable (Intercontinental)
# Simulates long-distance intercontinental connections
#
# Use case: Test CDN benefits, geo-distributed systems
# Typical scenario: US to Europe, US to Asia

name: "Submarine Cable"
description: "Intercontinental connection via submarine cable"
interface: ""

latency:
  delay_ms: 80       # ~80ms one-way (US to Europe)
  jitter_ms: 5       # Very stable
  correlation_pct: 0
  distribution: normal

packet_loss:
  loss_pct: 0.1      # Low loss (cables are reliable)
  correlation_pct: 0

# Note: For US to Asia, use delay_ms: 120
# Note: For US to Australia, use delay_ms: 150
